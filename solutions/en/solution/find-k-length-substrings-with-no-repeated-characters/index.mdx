<h3 id="solution_1">Solution 1: Sliding Window with Hash Map</h3>

We could use a sliding window to keep track of the current substring with no repeated characters. The sliding window has two sides: left side is stored in a variable `start`, and right side is in sync with the index `i` when iterating the string.

When iterating the string using a for loop with index `i`, the sliding window updates its right side to `i`, and we add a new character `c = s[i]` to current substring. We need to check whether the previous substring `s[start..(i-1)]` contains character `c`. If not, we don't need to update the left side of the sliding window. Otherwise, we need to update the left side so that the current substring does not contain repeated characters.

We can use a hashmap to store the character along with its latest index. If the hashmap does not contain `c`, or the index of `c` is less than `start` (`hashmap[c] < start`), it means that the previous substring `s[start..(i-1)]` does not contain the character `c`. Otherwise, we need to move the `start` to `hashmap[c] + 1` to exclude the original `c`.

After updating the current substring, we also update the `hashmap[c]` and calculate the length of the current substring. If it's greater than or equal to `k`, we find one substring of length `k` (`s[(i-k)..i]`) with no repeated characters and add 1 to `result`.

**Analysis:**

- **Time complexity:** $O(n)$. We use a for loop to iterate through the input string.
- **Space complexity:** $O(\text{min}(m,n))$, where `m` is the size of charset and `n` is the size of input string. Though we could treat it as $O(1)$ since `m` has fixed size.
