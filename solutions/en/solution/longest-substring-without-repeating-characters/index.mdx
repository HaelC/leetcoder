### Solution 1: Sliding Window

We can use sliding window to solve this problem, where the sliding window is the current substring without repeating characters. The sliding window's left side (variable named `begin` in the following code) is initialized as 0; while the right side is in sync with index `i` when iterating the input string.

When iterating the string, we increment `i` (the right side of the sliding window) by 1, which means a new character `c` at index `i` is added to the sliding window. We need to check whether the previous sliding window (from `begin` to `i - 1`) contains the character `c`. If the previous sliding window does not contain `c`, we don't need to update the sliding window's left side; otherwise, we need to move the left side so that the current sliding window will not contain repeating characters `c`.

How do we check if the previous sliding window contains `c`? Well we can check each character from `begin` to `i - 1`. There's a better option with a hash table. We can store the character together with its latest index in a `hashmap`. There are two cases indicating the previous sliding window does not contain `c`:

- The hash table does not contain `c`, which means we have never met `c` before.
- The hash table contains `c`, but `hashmap[c] < begin`, which means that we have met `c` before, but its index is less than `begin`.

If `hashmap[c] >= begin`, it means that the previous sliding window contains character `c`. We need to move the left side (`begin`) to `hashmap[c] + 1` to exclude the previous `c`.

After that, we calculate the width of the current sliding window(`i - begin + 1`), and store the character's index in the hashmap(`hashmap[c] = i`).

public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> hashmap;
        int longest = 0, n = s.length(), begin = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = s[i];
            if (hashmap.count(c) > 0 && hashmap[c] >= begin) {
                begin = hashmap[c] + 1;
            }
            longest = max(longest, i - begin + 1);
            hashmap[c] = i;
        }

        return longest;
    }
};

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();
        int longest = 0, n = s.length(), begin = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (hashmap.containsKey(c) && hashmap.get(c) >= begin) {
                begin = hashmap.get(c) + 1;
            }
            longest = Math.max(longest, i - begin + 1);
            hashmap.put(c, i);
        }

        return longest;
    }
}
```

**Analysis:**

- **Time complexity:** $O(n)$. We iterate the string with size of `n`.
- **Space complexity:** $O(\text{min}(m,n))$, where `m` is the size of charset and `n` is the size of input string.
